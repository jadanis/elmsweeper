# Elm Sweeper

## A Side Project
I've been meaning to code my own Mine Sweeper for a long time now. I stumbled on Elm recently and saw the [Flatris clone](https://github.com/w0rm/elm-flatris), (which I borrowed from heavily). This inspired me to build Mine Sweeper and learn Elm. This is the result of that effort (although a work in progress).

## Instructions to Run
1. Install [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/install)
1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
1. Run `elm make src/Main.elm --output=elm.js`
1. Open `index.html` with a browser
